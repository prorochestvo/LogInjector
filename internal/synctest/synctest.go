// Package synctest provides a mutex-guarded bytes.Buffer for the loginjector test
// suites. It is module-internal test scaffolding: both the root package's and the
// httptap package's test files may import it to obtain a buffer that is safe under
// concurrent Write/Read from many goroutines, without that type appearing in the
// shipped public API.
